<td style="text-align: center;">A University project game made over the course of a trimester in UE5 with Helena Barbillon and Mathis Ollier. This serves as a proof of concept for a plateformer where you play as a frog and can use your tongue as a grappling hook. </td>

<td style="text-align: center;"> Our entry for the UQAC WonderJam in the Fall of 2024. It is a 1v1 survival platformer. Ghosts appear from dark areas so each player tries to illuminate their part, avoid the ghosts and sabotage the other. Made with Unity</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">A work in progress personal project with my friend <a href="https://github.com/cizor-v">Oscar Cizeron</a> that I had in mind for a long time. The game is greatly inspired by WiiPlay's Tanks minigame, with the player trying to destroy all enemy tanks on screen. The twist here being the focus on completing a series of levels as fast as possible. Before every few levels, the player can choose between a variety of modifiers that fundamentally change the way the game plays. The link redirects to a prototype for the player's movement.

<td style="text-align: center;">A university project focused on getting familiar with AGILE project management / the SCRUM method. We had to develop an app to find recipes using what was left over in the fridge in Java. We worked as a team of six, with regular sprint planning meetings, and sprint retrospectives.</td>
